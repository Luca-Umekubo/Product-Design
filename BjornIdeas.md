Arena Modification

- Adding bouncy walls around the arena adds another dimension to the game, balls can now be thrown off the walls and floors like rocket league

- Arena types change game play mechanics so it doesnt get boring, ice arena where you slide around, parkour like map

Movement

- Adding dashes to make the game faster paced, it has a short or medium charge time so it isnt OP but allows the player to dash up, sideways, forwards and back
