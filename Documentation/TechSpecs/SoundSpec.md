## 4. Process Flows

### 4.1 Sound Effect Playback Flow
1. Game event occurs (e.g., player throws ball)
2. `GameEventManager` dispatches event
3. `SoundEventSystem.TriggerEvent()` receives event
4. System checks for cooldowns and priorities
5. Appropriate sound is selected (possibly with variations)
6. `AudioManager.PlaySoundEffect()` is called with position data
7. Sound is spatialized based on listener position
8. Volume and pitch may be modified based on context
9. Sound plays through pooled audio source

### 4.2 Dynamic Music Flow
1. Match begins with `AudioManager.PlayMusic("match_start")`
2. As match progresses, `DynamicAudioSystem.UpdateIntensity()` is called
3. Based on intensity, music may:
   - Increase in volume
   - Add instrument layers
   - Transition to more intense track
4. On final countdown, transition to urgent music
5. On match end, transition to victory/defeat music

### 4.3 Voice Announcement Flow
1. Significant game event occurs (player elimination, power-up spawn)
2. `VoiceAnnouncementSystem.QueueAnnouncement()` is called
3. System evaluates priority of new announcement
4. If higher priority than current, may interrupt
5. Otherwise, added to queue
6. Announcements play in sequence with appropriate spacing

## 5. Performance Considerations

### 5.1 Audio Pooling
- Pre-allocate audio sources to avoid runtime instantiation
- Limit concurrent sounds based on priority and distance
- Implement culling for distant sound sources

### 5.2 Memory Management
- Stream longer audio like music from disk
- Use compressed formats for most audio
- Implement progressive loading for level-specific audio

### 5.3 CPU Optimization
- Limit DSP effects based on device capability
- Batch audio processing where possible
- Adjust audio quality settings based on performance metrics

## 6. External Dependencies and Relationships

### 6.1 Game Systems Integration
- `PlayerController` - Triggers movement and action sounds
- `BallPhysics` - Provides velocity/impact force for sound scaling
- `PowerUpManager` - Triggers power-up audio effects
- `GameStateManager` - Provides game state for musical transitions
- `UIManager` - Triggers UI sound effects

### 6.2 Content Pipeline
- Audio asset naming conventions
- Folder structure for audio files
- Audio compression and conversion guidelines
- Voice recording specifications

## 7. Future Enhancements (Non-Core)
- Real-time audio synthesis for procedural effects
- HRTF-based 3D audio for enhanced spatial perception
- Audio accessibility features
- Voice chat integration
- Custom music playlists
