## about the game

Imagine a party pvp minigame meets a first person shooter meets dodgeball. this game is a fast paced multiplayer dodgeball fighter/shooter set on a raised platform in a neon lit arena where you have to time dodges, choose and use abilities, and collect powerups to eliminate the other team. the game focuses on fluid and fun movement while trying to capture the fun/frustration of a party game as well as the competetiveness of a first person shooter like overwatch, halo, splitgate, or krunker. the target audience is any casual or competetive gamer that likes the feeling of fast paced first person shooter games with quick and responsive movement. it should be really fun to play/motivating to win and the mechanics should feel rewarding and engaging.

## gameplay

- players spawned on a raised platform above a void in a large neon arena
- each player has 2 lives, and after they are lost, they are out and spectate (possablity to get back in?)
- a few balls (half of players?) start in the center of the field, and a quicktime event determines how fast you can get to the cetnerline to grab a ball happens at the beggining
- when a player has a ball, they can either quick throw, a throw with less speed, or go into an aiming state described below.
- when a player has a ball, they can go into an aiming state either from the ground or mid jump. if in the air, pause in the air where they are, hovering, if on the ground, movement speed reduced. this aiming state gives a chace for the players on the other side to anticipate the throw and try to dodge it. the player throwing can pump fake to try and draw out a dodge and the player dodging has a dodge left right, duck or jump on a cooldown, so they have to anticipate a throw vs a pump fake.
- after balls are thrown, they dont fly/fall off the arena/platform like players could, instead kept in by an invisible wall that only affects the balls
- players cant directly catch a throw, as it is too fast, but if a player on your team gets hit by a ball, it will fly in a random direction and you can catch it to keep the hit player in and the thrown player to lose a life. catching a ball also gives one life back to an out player or the lowest health player on the team.
- at a random time around halfway through the game, a powerup will spawn on the centerline and if a player hits it with a ball or touches it physically, it will activate for the team.
- teams/players also cannot horde balls, and they will go to the other team if held too long
- dodgeballs also have a bit of knockback, so they can push an enemy off the stage

## interface

- fighting game-like interface with a timer on the top so the match doesnt go on too long, and the profile pictures/of the players on their team with their number of lives and ultimate ability charge bar underneath

## Power system

- players can choose between three characters, each with a unique power and the same ultimate throw that charges up .
    - ultimate throw: ultimate ability that charges up over a while and can be activated like smash bros or overwatch, giving their next throw even faster speed (visualized by on fire ball) and more time in the aim state. this throw also has much more knockback and can knock players off the stage more easily.
    - character 1: architect
        - can summon temporary walls to hide behind for a few seconds with a long cooldown
    - character 2: trickster
        - can go invisible and create a decoy in their place that goes into the aim animation.
    - character 3: agressor
        - ability to set ball on fire, leaving a temporary trail of flames on the ground wherever the ball is thrown that doesnt do damage but players cannot cross and will be knocked back from it, creating a way for the agressor to crowd/herd the enemy team. fire ball also does more knockback with an explosion doing splash knockback.

## powerups

- time slow:
    - when collected, a 10 second period starts where the other team's movement and thrown balls will be slower
- hunt:
    - when collected, each player on that team gets a player on the other team to "hunt" for a certain amount of time. if they hit their target, their targets lives go to zero and
    - their targets will be shown on their screen and above their heads so the opposing team can see who is hunting who
- golden ball:
    - when collected, a short period starts where the balls turn golden and immediatley do full health damage instead of one life
- ballstorm:
    - when collected, a rain of dodgeballs spawns on your side of the arena, all created balls despawn after 15 seconds
- firechain:
    - any hit from your team causes a mini-explosion that can damage anyone in a small radius around the hit player for 30 seconds.
