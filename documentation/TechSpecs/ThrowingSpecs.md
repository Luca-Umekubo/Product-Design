# ThrowingSpec.md

## ðŸ”¹ Part of the Design Being Laid Out

This spec covers the **throwing mechanics** in the dodgeball game. It corresponds to the flow:

```
[Player] â”€â”€â–¶ throws â”€â”€â–¶ [Ball] â”€â”€â–¶ moves_with â”€â”€â–¶ [Physics]
       
        uses
         
     [TypeOfThrow] â”€â”€â–¶ affects â”€â”€â–¶ [Ball]
```

Relevant classes from the diagram: `Player`, `Ball`, `TypeOfThrow`, `Physics`

---

## ðŸ§© Object: `Player`

### Expected Variables:
- `hasBall: boolean` â€“ Whether the player currently holds the ball.
- `position: Vector3` â€“ Current location of the player.
- `teamID: int` â€“ (Optional) Player's team ID.

### Expected Methods:
- `ThrowBall(type: TypeOfThrow): void` â€“ Initiates the throw using a specified throw type.

### Related Objects:
- Owns and throws a `Ball`.
- Uses a `TypeOfThrow` to determine how to throw.

---

## ðŸ§© Object: `Ball`

### Expected Variables:
- `state: BallState` â€“ Enum: `inAir`, `ground`, `onPlayer`.
- `position: Vector3` â€“ Current ball position.
- `owner: Player` â€“ Who currently owns the ball.
- `hitbox: float` â€“ Simplified collision radius.

### Expected Methods:
- `checkCollision(): bool` â€“ Checks if ball collides with another object.
- `updatePosition(delta: float): void` â€“ Updates ball's location each frame.

### Related Objects:
- Receives force from `TypeOfThrow`.
- Moved via `Physics` methods.

---

## ðŸ§© Object: `TypeOfThrow`

### Expected Variables:
- `speed: float` â€“ How fast the ball travels.
- `accuracy: float` â€“ Chance that throw stays on trajectory.

### Expected Methods:
- `calculateTrajectory(target: Vector3): Vector3` â€“ Outputs a velocity vector to hit target.
- `ApplyThrow(ball: Ball): void` â€“ Applies calculated velocity to the ball.

### Related Objects:
- Used by `Player` to throw.
- Affects `Ball` with force vector.

---

## ðŸ§© Object: `Physics`

### Expected Variables:
- `gravity: float` â€“ Downward force on the ball.

### Expected Methods:
- `ApplyForce(ball: Ball, force: Vector3): void` â€“ Adds a velocity/force to the ball.
- `+ method(type): type` â€“ Placeholder for future physics extensions (e.g. friction, spin).

### Related Objects:
- Acts on `Ball` when it is in air.

---

## âœ… Summary of Key Interactions

- Player uses `TypeOfThrow` to apply velocity to a `Ball`.
- `Ball` is moved by `Physics`, simulating trajectory.
- Collision can be checked using `Ball.checkCollision()`.

The above definitions and relationships provide all basic functionality for a working throw mechanic in a 3D dodgeball game.
